Whip until stiff, glossy peaks form.\nStep4: Macaronage: Gently fold the sifted almond flour and powdered sugar mixture into the whipped egg whites. This process is called macaronage. Fold until the batter is smooth and shiny, but be careful not to overmix.\nStep5: Piping: Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe small circles onto the prepared baking sheets. You can use a template for consistent sizing.\nStep6: Resting: Allow the piped macarons to rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. This helps them develop a skin. \nStep7: Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C).\nStep8: Bake: Bake the macarons for 15-18 minutes or until they have formed feet and are set. The exact time may vary, so keep an eye on them.\nStep9: Cooling: Allow the macarons to cool completely on the baking sheets before attempting to remove them.\n\nFilling:\nStep1: Prepare Filling: In a bowl, beat together softened butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.\nStep2: Assemble: Match up similar-sized macaron shells and spread or pipe a small amount of filling onto one shell. Top with another shell to create a sandwich.\nStep3: Final Touch: Optionally, let the assembled macarons rest in the refrigerator for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld.",
